- Top 5 Important Features:
- Weight: 0.2911 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 0.0966 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Height: 0.0798 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- NCP: 0.0581 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- FAF: 0.0488 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: RFC relies on feature preprocessing and may be sensitive to parameter settings.

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.1076) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R² reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.
