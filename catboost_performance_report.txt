- Top 5 Important Features:
- Weight: 42.2816 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Height: 14.1519 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 7.0975 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Gender_Male: 5.7240 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- NCP: 3.6870 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: CATBOOST handles categorical features natively, potentially improving performance over one-hot encoded models

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.0649) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R² reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.

Potential Reasons for Misclassifications:
- Class Imbalance: Classes with fewer samples may have higher error rates due to underrepresentation.
- Feature Overlap: Classes with similar feature distributions (e.g., Overweight_Level_I and Overweight_Level_II) may be harder to distinguish.
- Model Limitations: The model may struggle with boundary cases where features like Weight and Height are close to decision thresholds.
