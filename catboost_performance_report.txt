- Top 5 Important Features:
- Weight: 45.5083 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Height: 13.3190 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Gender_Male: 9.6540 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 4.6392 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- CH2O: 4.3444 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: CATBOOST handles categorical features natively, potentially improving performance over one-hot encoded models

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.0575) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R² reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.
