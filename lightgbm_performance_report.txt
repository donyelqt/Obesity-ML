- Height: 1501.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 681.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- FAF: 375.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- TUE: 374.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: LIGHTGBM relies on feature preprocessing and may be sensitive to parameter settings.

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.0795) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R² reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.

Potential Reasons for Misclassifications:
- Class Imbalance: Classes with fewer samples may have higher error rates due to underrepresentation.
- Feature Overlap: Classes with similar feature distributions (e.g., Overweight_Level_I and Overweight_Level_II) may be harder to distinguish.
- Model Limitations: The model may struggle with boundary cases where features like Weight and Height are close to decision thresholds.
