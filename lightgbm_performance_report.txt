- Top 5 Important Features:
- Weight: 2370.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Height: 1501.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 681.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- FAF: 375.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- TUE: 374.0000 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: LIGHTGBM relies on feature preprocessing and may be sensitive to parameter settings.

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.0795) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R² reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.
