- Top 5 Important Features:
- Weight: 0.4492 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Height: 0.1230 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Gender_Female: 0.0543 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Gender_Male: 0.0527 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- Age: 0.0388 (likely critical for obesity classification)
- General Behavior: EXTRATREES relies on feature preprocessing and may be sensitive to parameter settings.

5. Interpretations:
- Accuracy improvement suggests tuning enhanced generalization.
- Low CV score variance (0.0737) indicates robust performance across data splits.
- MSE and R� reflect prediction consistency, though more relevant for regression tasks.
- Confusion matrix patterns and feature importance (if applicable) highlight key decision factors in obesity classification.
